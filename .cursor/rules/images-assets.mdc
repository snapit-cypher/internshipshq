# Images & Assets (Hard Rules)

- **Figma extraction:** Use the **original file**; select the image in the right
  panel and download from the provided source.
- **Compression:** Compress all images with Squoosh before adding to the repo.
- For help with compression, reach out to **Malay Khan** (team-specific).
- Asset placement:
  - **Common images** → `public/common/`
  - **Page-specific images** → `public/<page>/`
- Keep filenames lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `hero-illustration.png`).
