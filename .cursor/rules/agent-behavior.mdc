# Agent Behavior (Hard Rules)

- **No file edits** until the user replies **`APPROVE`** (or
  **`HOTFIX APPROVED`** for emergencies).
- **Show code in chat only** prior to approval; do not create/modify files.
- **Ask clarifying questions** and request design/inspiration assets before
  coding UI.
- **No new libraries/patterns** unless explicitly asked by the user.
- **Confidence Gate:** If **Confidence < 9.5/10**, keep discussing—do not
  proceed.
- **Footer Requirement:** End every message with `Confidence: X.X/10`.
