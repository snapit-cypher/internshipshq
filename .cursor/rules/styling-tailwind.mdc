# Styling & Class Management (Hard Rules)

- For **long Tailwind class lists**, break across multiple lines and use the
  project’s `cn` helper.
- For **conditional classes**, always use `cn` for clarity and consistency.
- Keep styles **consistent with existing tokens and patterns**; do not introduce
  new utility conventions without request.
- No extra/unnecessary spaces or line breaks—keep code neat and concise.
